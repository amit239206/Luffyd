            <p class="descrip"> The Straw Hats are an extremely diverse group possessing a large variety of backgrounds.
                Their members' origins range from ordinary islanders and workers to bounty hunters, royalty, criminal
                gang members, and veteran pirates; Jinbe was once part of the renowned Seven Warlords of the Sea while
                Robin was an active enemy of the crew at one point with Baroque Works. The crew consists of eight
                humans, one fish-man, and one animal with Devil Fruit-powered human intellect; of the humans, Sanji
                possesses superhuman modifications given to him at birth, Franky is a cyborg, and Brook possesses a
                skeleton body after being resurrected by a Devil Fruit power. They range in age from 17 (Chopper) to 90
                (Brook); the median age of the crew is 21.</p>
