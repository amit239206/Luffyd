            <h1>Luffy</h1>
            <p class="info">Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since
                childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail
                from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol
                D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".</p>
            <br>
            <p class="info">
                Zoro originally used two swords instead of three.[4] Zoro was originally planned to be part of Buggy the
                Clown’s pirate crew and would have been recruited by Luffy away from Buggy. Zoro's surname was based on
                the Japanese pronunciation of French pirate François l'Olonnais. In several Western localizations, his
                name was changed to Zolo.

            <br>
            <p class="info">Nami is the Straw Hat Pirates' navigator, who dreams of drawing a map of the entire world. Despite her
                initial distrust of pirates, Nami eventually changes her mind after being around Luffy and the rest of
                the crew. Nami is depicted as an intelligent girl who is obsessed with obtaining money. She is able to
                use her three-sectioned staff and her climate skills to create powerful attacks; the most prominent of
                these staff weapons is the Klima-Tact, in which she manipulates the climate to create weather-based
                attacks.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="info">He was the fourth member to join Luffy's crew and the third officially after the confrontation they had
                with Captain Kuro.[3] His dream is to become a great pirate like his father Yasopp, member of the
                Red-Haired Pirates of "Red-Haired" Shanks.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="info">A native to the North Blue, Sanji grew up as part of the Vinsmoke family under his father Vinsmoke Judge,
                king of the Germa Kingdom, and mother Vinsmoke Sora.[4] Living under a grueling father who only saw
                Sanji as a soldier, he escapes to Baratie where he learns to cook under “Red Leg” Zeff[5] and learns his
                fighting style, which is characterized by the use of legs in combat. Although his demeanor mostly
                consist of him being calm and collected, he is also shown to have a heavy attraction to beautiful women,
                as exemplified via the hearts in his eyes. Sanji is the fifth member and the fourth to join Monkey D.
                Luffy’s pirate crew as cook after the battle against Don Krieg.</p>
